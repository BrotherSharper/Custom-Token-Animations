# Custom-Token-Animations

This adds the option to add custon defined icons with rotation onto tokens. Primerily designed for things like Ioun Stones, Minute Meterors, Crown of Stars, Animated Weapons etc.

There are several macro commands to alter these traits but the simplest option is to use the "dotted circle" icon in the token control bar with a token selected.
